This is just a memo.

Here's what we're going to try today.
We will try to improve the camera interface by adding some functionality.
- Exposure time
- Acquisition Mode
- Software Trigger (How do we use this thing even?)

We got news. After all, it seems like it was a bad idea to have different Classes set textboxes and stuff
from outside. It seems like form elements shouldn't be set to public no matter what.
The form class should contain all the logic neccessary to control and change it's components.
I could let other classes do some work, but the changes in textboxes ect. have to be done within
the form class.

Let's ignore the design issues and just add the exposure time thing!
