This is just a memo.

Here's what we're going to try today.
We will try to improve the camera interface by adding some functionality.
- Exposure time
- Acquisition Mode
- Software Trigger (How do we use this thing even?)

We got news. After all, it seems like it was a bad idea to have different Classes set textboxes and stuff
from outside. It seems like form elements shouldn't be set to public no matter what.
The form class should contain all the logic neccessary to control and change it's components.
I could let other classes do some work, but the changes in textboxes ect. have to be done within
the form class.

Let's ignore the design issues and just add the exposure time thing!

But wait. There's more.

What kind of funtions have to be added no matter what?
We are pretty good on the pulsmotor front.
We are pretty good on the matlab front. not much to do here anyway.
We got work left to do on the camera front!
To be precise, it's about the following stuff.
	1. Get the partial scan settings.
	2. get the software trigger to work. We need to read the manual to understand this better.
	3. maybe get the ROI settings, since they seem to get set automatically once the partial scan thing get's set.

What about the report on the light source?
How could it look like?
We could show the pictures we made and conclude, that it would be better to use the wide lens.
let's just do the programming.
and write some stuff to m. as soon as it is time to do so!
